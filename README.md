## Installation

```bash

git clone git@github.com:noforit/Lookahead_Q-Cache.git
cd Lookahead_Q-Cache
conda create -n LAQ python=3.12
conda activate LAQ
pip install -r requirements.txt .

```
## LongBench

You can obtain the results of LAQ on LongBench by referring to the `run_LAQ.sh` and modifying the corresponding parameters.

```bash
bash run_LAQ.sh
```


## Needle in haystack


```bash
bash run_needle.sh
```

After inference, run

`python scripts/scripts_needle/visualize.py`

to draw the img, you should change `FOLDER_PATH` in `visualize.py` to your output path.
